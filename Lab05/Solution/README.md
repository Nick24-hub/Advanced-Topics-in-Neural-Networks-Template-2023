- implemented logging system using Tensorboard
- evaluated the performance of SGD, Adam, RMSprop, AdaGrad
- best accuracy obtained: 0.4823 on validation and 0.4228 on train with Adam with learning_rate = 0.001 and batch size = 256 after 100 epochs
- obtained better accuracy on validation because I used v2.RandAugment() in trainset trainsform pipeline

Expected points: 5
